\section{Conclusions and known limitations}\label{sec:knownlimitations}
 There are a number of known limitations of the script, and almost certainly quite a
 few that are \emph{unknown}!

 For example, \texttt{latexindent.pl} will not indent the following code correctly,
 because of the unmatched \lstinline![!. I'm hopeful to be able to resolve this
 issue in a future version.

 \begin{lstlisting}[,nolol=true,]
\parbox{
\@ifnextchar[{\@assignmentwithcutoff}{\@assignmentnocutoff}
}
\end{lstlisting}

 The main other limitation is to do with the alignment routine of environments/commands that contain
 delimiters which are specified in \texttt{lookForAlignDelims}.

 The routine works well for `standard' blocks of code that have the same number of \lstinline!&!
 per line, but it will not do anything for lines that do not -- such examples
 include \texttt{tabular} environments that use \lstinline!\multicolumn! or
 perhaps spread cell contents across multiple lines.  For each alignment block (\texttt{tabular},
 \texttt{align}, etc) \texttt{latexindent.pl} first of all makes a record
 of the maximum number of \lstinline!&!; if each row does not have that
 number of \lstinline!&! then it will not try to format that row. Details
 will be given in \texttt{indent.log} assuming that \texttt{trace} mode
 is active.

 You can run \texttt{latexindent} on \texttt{.sty}, \texttt{.cls} and any file types
 that you specify in \lstinline[breaklines=true]!fileExtensionPreference! (see \vref{lst:fileExtensionPreference});
 if you find a case in which the script struggles, please feel free
 to report it at \cite{latexindent-home}, and
 in the meantime, consider using a \texttt{noIndentBlock} (see \cpageref{lst:noIndentBlockdemo}).

 I hope that this script is useful to some; if you find an example where the
 script does not behave as you think it should, the best way to contact me is to
 report an issue on \cite{latexindent-home}; otherwise, feel free to find me on
