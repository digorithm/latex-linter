\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Thanks}
	I first created \texttt{latexindent.pl} to help me format chapter files
	in a big project. After I blogged about it on the
	\TeX{} stack exchange \cite{cmhblog} I received some positive feedback and
	follow-up feature requests. A big thank you to Harish Kumar who
	helped to develop and test the initial versions of the script.

	The \texttt{YAML}-based interface of \texttt{latexindent.pl} was inspired
	by the wonderful \texttt{arara} tool; any similarities are deliberate, and
	I hope that it is perceived as the compliment that it is. Thank you to Paulo Cereda and the
	team for releasing this awesome tool; I initially worried that I was going to
	have to make a GUI for \texttt{latexindent.pl}, but the release of \texttt{arara}
	has meant there is no need.

	There have been several contributors to the project so far (and hopefully more in
	the future!); thank you very much to the people detailed in \vref{sec:contributors}
	for their valued contributions, and thank you to those who report bugs and request features
	at \cite{latexindent-home}.

\subsection{License}
	\texttt{latexindent.pl} is free and open source, and it always will be.
	Before you start using it on any important files, bear in mind that \texttt{latexindent.pl} has the option to overwrite your \texttt{.tex} files.
	It will always make at least one backup (you can choose how many it makes, see \cpageref{page:onlyonebackup})
	but you should still be careful when using it. The script has been tested on many
	files, but there are some known limitations (see \cref{sec:knownlimitations}).
	You, the user, are responsible for ensuring that you maintain backups of your files
	before running \texttt{latexindent.pl} on them. I think it is important at this
	stage to restate an important part of the license here:
	\begin{quote}\itshape
		This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
		but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
		MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
		GNU General Public License for more details.
	\end{quote}
	There is certainly no malicious intent in releasing this script, and I do hope
	that it works as you expect it to; if it does not, please first of all
	make sure that you have the correct settings, and then feel free to let me know at \cite{latexindent-home} with a
	complete minimum working example as I would like to improve the code as much as possible.
	\begin{warning}
		Before you try the script on anything important (like your thesis), test it
		out on the sample files in the \texttt{test-case} directory \cite{latexindent-home}.
	\end{warning}

	\emph{If you have used any version 2.* of \texttt{latexindent.pl}, there
		are a few changes to the interface; see \vref{app:differences} and the comments
		throughout this document for details}.
